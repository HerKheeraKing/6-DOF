# 6-DOF

This project brings servo-controlled movements to life with smooth, automated motion, using Lerp functions to match SolidWorks-simulated ranges. In the main loop, it calculates elapsed time relative to each step and moves the "heave" motion through up, center, and down positions every 500ms for a total of 2 seconds. Then, it sequences through sway, surge, heave, pitch, roll, and yaw in a smooth 12-second cycle. If any movements are too subtle, the code recalibrates to add more noticeable motion based on updated simulation settings.

START OF PROJECT~

The first step of this project was to design a Stewart platform in SolidWorks, capturing precise measurements of the platformâ€™s positions as it moves through all six degrees of freedom (6DOF). I decided to add a cool spaceman design on top of the platform for the theme of the game I will be going with later in the project:
