# 6-DOF Mini Flight Simulator
##### <p align="center"> Ever wondered how theme park rides or flight simulators make your body feel like you're moving, even when you're not?
</p>

  <p align="center"> This mini Stewart platform is a scaled-down, servo-powered replica designed to recreate that same sensation! Just like the full-size flight simulator we've been building at Uni.

# How it works:
üîÅ Smooth motion control: Servo motors use Lerp functions to match real movement ranges from our SolidWorks simulation.

‚è±Ô∏è Timing-based movement: Every 500ms, the platform shifts through heave positions up, center, and down for a total of 2 seconds.

üéØ Full motion cycle: Then it glides through a 12-second loop of:
‚Üí sway, surge, heave, pitch, roll, and yaw

üõ†Ô∏è Auto-adjusts for clarity: If the movements feel too subtle, the code automatically recalibrates to make the motion more noticeable.
